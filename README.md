<h1 align="center">Colourful Memory</h1>

[View the live project here.]()

A sequence and memory testing game that uses a 3x3 grid pattern of squares that light up in random order with a random colour.  The user must remember this order and color executing it back using clicks and color selection.  The site will provide a peaceful and focused place for the user to challenge themselves and have fun.

## User Experience Goals (UX)
    1. The site should be simple to understand and easy to engage with, even without detailed reading of the instructions.
    2. The content should meet the requierement of challenging a range of skill levels with a lower-end of difficulty that all will be able to perform and upper-end that only the best memory can meet.
    3. The atmosphere of the background and interactions should be undistracting and subdued, so that the user can stay focused and concentrate on the game 
    4. The user will want unobtrusive confirmation of how they are performing and what they did right or wrong.

## Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    Varius shades of blue will be used making the background easy on the eyes with the squares being light cream in colour.
